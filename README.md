My 2nd miniproject with codingtemple!

To use, simply run the contactManagementSystem.py and follow the prompts.  

It will ask for you to either add a contact manually to start, or import from a contacts.txt file (one is already provided with dummy contacts for demoing).  

I've done my best to try and keep the main program as clean and simple as possible by offloading as much as I can to the portable functions I've developed in the functions.py file.   

To save your contact list, just choose to export it in the program; it'l be saved to the contacts.txt file while a backup is made of the prior version in the backups folder.   

The only bug that I know of is that the text coloring within the windows terminal does not work. This apears to be due to an update for windows 10 that prevents this functionality by default. I will be searching for a better alternative for how I am coloring text in my programs, but at least with this there are still some terminals including IDEs that will have no trouble rendering the colors.   

Hope you enjoy!
